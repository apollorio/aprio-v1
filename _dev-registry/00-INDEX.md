## Immediate attention

| finding | count | where |
|---|---|---|
| REST **endpoints** with `permission_callback => __return_true` | 112 | `12-SECURITY-SURFACE.md` |
| — of those accepting writes | 15 | `12-SECURITY-SURFACE.md` |
| REST endpoints with **no** `permission_callback` | 0 | `12-SECURITY-SURFACE.md` |
| AJAX actions reachable logged-out (`nopriv`) | 14 | `12-SECURITY-SURFACE.md` |
| meta keys written but never governed | 224 | `05-META-KEYS.md` |
| governed meta keys never touched in code | 63 | `05-META-KEYS.md` |
| CPTs registered but absent from `cpts.php` | 2 (journal_news, journal_nota) | `03-CPT.md` |
| unguarded cross-plugin function calls | 43 | `11-DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| open defects carried from evidence root | 9 | `13-KNOWN-DEFECTS.md` |


## Reading order

Start at `01-BOOT-AND-OWNERSHIP.md`. It explains the single rule that makes
the rest of the numbers make sense: **apollo-core registers everything as a
fallback, and every owner plugin yields to it via an existence guard.**
Without that rule, `03-CPT.md` looks like fifteen duplicate registrations.
